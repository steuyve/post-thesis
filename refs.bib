	abstract = {Magnitude is an isometric invariant of metric spaces inspired by category theory. Recent work has shown that the asymptotic behavior under rescaling of the magnitude of subsets of Euclidean space is closely related to intrinsic volumes. Here we prove an upper bound for the magnitude of a convex body in Euclidean space in terms of its intrinsic volumes. The result is deduced from an analogous known result for magnitude in \${\textbackslash}ell\_1{\textasciicircum}N\$, via approximate embeddings of Euclidean space into high-dimensional \${\textbackslash}ell\_1{\textasciicircum}N\$ spaces. As a consequence, we deduce a sufficient condition for infinite-dimensional subsets of a Hilbert space to have finite magnitude. The upper bound is also shown to be sharp to first order for an odd-dimensional Euclidean ball shrinking to a point; this complements recent work investigating the asymptotics of magnitude for large dilatations of sets in Euclidean space.},

	abstract = {The notion of the magnitude of a metric space was introduced by Leinster in [8] and developed in [10], [9], [11] and [16], but the magnitudes of familiar sets in Euclidean space are only understood in relatively few cases. In this paper we study the magnitudes of compact sets in Euclidean spaces. We first describe the asymptotics of the magnitude of such sets in both the small and large-scale regimes. We then consider the magnitudes of compact convex sets with nonempty interior in Euclidean spaces of odd dimension, and relate them to the boundary behaviour of solutions to certain naturally associated higher order elliptic boundary value problems in exterior domains. We carry out calculations leading to an algorithm for explicit evaluation of the magnitudes of balls, and this establishes the convex magnitude conjecture of Leinster and Willerton [9] in the special case of balls in dimension three. In general we show that the magnitude of an odd-dimensional ball is a rational function of its radius. In addition to Fourier-analytic and {PDE} techniques, the arguments also involve some combinatorial considerations.},

Firstly, a heuristic is given for deriving this valuation by considering 'large' subspaces of Euclidean space and, secondly, numerical approximations to the magnitude are calculated for squares, disks, cubes, annuli, tori and Sierpinski gaskets. The valuation is seen to be very close to the magnitude for the convex spaces considered and is seen to be 'asymptotically' close for some other spaces.},

This is done by finding a distribution on the ball which solves the weight equations. Using Schr{\textbackslash}"oder paths and a continued fraction expansion for the generating function of the reverse Bessel polynomials, combinatorial formulae are given for the numerator and denominator of the magnitude of each odd dimensional ball.
